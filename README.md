# MC3113 Line Follower Demo

This repository contains MATLAB scripts for a demo line-follower digital twin:

- `DemoMain.m` – entry point to run a demonstration
- `ICD_Definition.m` – interface control definition example
- `Requirements_RTM.m` – requirements and traceability mapping
- `Scenario_S1.m` – nominal scenario setup
- `Scenario_S3.m` – fault scenario setup
- `VerificationReport.m` – example verification report script

The full course project will extend this into a shared digital twin for all student teams.
